(Stress Detection from Human Voice using Machine Learning)

---

Overview:

With the increasing psychological pressures in daily life, rapid detection of stress symptoms is highly important. In this project, human voice signals are received, and specific features such as pitch, energy, formant frequencies, and more are extracted. A machine learning model is then trained to detect stress based on these features.

How to Use:

1. Prepare the audio data (voice files in a suitable format).  
2. Extract features (pitch, energy, formant frequencies, etc.).  
3. Train the machine learning model with the data.  
4. Use the trained model to detect stress in new samples.
